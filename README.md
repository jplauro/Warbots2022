## Game

The game during the 2022 season is called Rapid React. Teams shoot large, inflatable balls, known as Cargo, into a central hub on the field to score points. There are two scoring methods, with the low goal gaining one point and the high goal scoring two points. The match starts with autonomous mode, otherwise known as Taxi, where teams utilize a preconfigured routine to score multiple balls and double points in the goals. The match then transitions to the teleoperated period when drivers handle the robot and pay close attention to the field, scoring points and defending against other robots as needed. The match concludes when robots navigate to the hangars in the field's corners and climb the monkey bars. The highest bar is called the Traversal Rung and can earn a team fifteen points. The other three bars, from high to low, net ten, six, and four points, respectively. Certain thresholds must be met to receive Rank Points, which allow advancement in the overall rankings.

## Goals

| Goal                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                         | Status   |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Dual-Controller System       | Have two controllers that work in conjunction with each other to provide buttons for both a driver and an operator.                                                                 | Complete |
| Multiple Autonomous Routines | Allow a specific routine to be selected from a group of applicable choices in Shuffleboard before the match starts, allowing for a better and more dynamic match strategy.          | Complete |
| Climber Control Sequences    | Have the climber controls defined as a series of commands grouped to only a few buttons, minimizing the number of steps that the operator must take to maintain a successful climb. | Complete |
| Differential Drivetrain      | Use the differential form of a drivetrain with support for tank drive, arcade drive, and curvature drive.                                                                           | Complete |
| Smart Intake                 | Develop an intaking procedure that uses limit switch feedback to automatically determine when to stop.                                                                              | Complete |
| Vision Tracking              | Interpret data from the Limelight and move the turret to the center-most point without needing manual adjustments.                                                                  | Complete |
| Interpolation Map            | Use a map of empirically-tested RPM values to input a calculated linear interpolation point into a PID controller.                                                                  | Complete |
| Turret Calibration           | Drive the turret into a physical limit switch near the front of the robot, calibrating the turret to the same degree position every time.                                           | Complete |
| Gyro Locking                 | Allow the turret to face a certain field-oriented direction regardless of the robot's drivetrain movements, ensuring that a target is always seen.                                  | Complete |
| Hub Tracking                 | Record the field position of the central hub, guaranteeing that it can be tracked to its present location throughout the entirety of a match.                                       | Complete |
| Bling Lights                 | Display a complicated pattern of colors on an LED strip, signaling certain robot states to the drivers.                                                                             | Complete |
| Simulation                   | Mimic the robot's physical environment in a virtual setting to allow general robot testing and bug fixing to be completed without actually requiring robot access.                  | Complete |
